# Clothing Similarity Assessment using Siamese Network

## 🔄 Overview:
This project aims to create a multi-input model using a Siamese Network to find the similarity or dissimilarity between items of clothing. The focus of the project will be on constructing the network and custom loss functions using TensorFlow, Numpy, Matplotlib, and PIL. The dataset used will be the Fashion MNIST, which will be imported, prepared, and used to train the model. The evaluation of the model's performance will also be performed.

## 🎊 Motivation:
Clothing items have become an essential part of our daily lives. With the increasing popularity of online shopping, it has become challenging to determine the similarity between different clothing items. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a model that can accurately assess the similarity between items of clothing.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Learn about Siamese Networks and their applications
2)	Understand the process of creating and training a multi-input model
3)	Learn about custom loss functions and their implementation in TensorFlow
4)	Gain experience with data preprocessing and visualization techniques using Numpy, Matplotlib, and PIL
5)	Evaluate the performance of the trained model

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
This project involves building a Siamese Network using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The model will take two images of clothing items as input and produce a similarity score as output. The project also requires implementing custom loss functions to optimize the model's performance.

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project will use TensorFlow, Numpy, Matplotlib, PIL.

## 📚 Data Source:
The project will use a Fashion MNIST.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
1)	Fashion MNIST imports
2)	Preparation of the dataset
3)	Construction of the Siamese Network model
4)	Training the model
5)	Evaluation of the model's performance
